    Digital DI Programming: Setup

    Welcome to the Digital DI programming class! In this lesson, 
    we will learn how to make the computer run our code. For this
    class, we will be using a programming language called javascript
    as well as a library called P5.js. We're doing this to get familiar
    with the environment we will be using in the lesson Let's get started!

    Vocab:
        Programing Language: A programming language is a collection of
                             human readable operations that a computer
                             can understand. There are many different 
                             programming languages such as javascript,
                             C, and python. In our class we will be 
                             using javascript.
        Library: A library is a collection of code someone else has 
                 already written for you. By using a library, we
                 can avoid "reinvinting the wheel" every time we 
                 want to write a new program. We can also view a library
                 as adding extra functionality to our programming language
                 For example, in our class, we will use a library called
                 P5.js, which adds the ability to draw pictures using 
                 code.
        Comment: A comment allows us as programmers to tell the computer
                 NOT to read part of our code. This allows us to explain
                 our code to the reader. In javascript, we can make a single
                 line comment by typing //, or a multi-line comment by 
                 putting everything we want to say in between two /* 's like
                 I've done for this section. This is super important because 
                 the computer doesn't understand english, so everything I've
                 written would confuse it.
        string: A string is text that you want the computer to know about. In
                javasctipt, a string is denoted by wrapping the words you want
                in quotation marks. For example "Hello World!" is a string. If
                you don't put the quotation marks around it, the computer gets
                confused because it's trying to understand the words you wrote
                as code rather than as words.

/*
    In order to begin coding, we need a place to run our code. Open up your
    web browser and navigate to https://editor.p5js.org/. Here, you should 
    see a "play" button, a box with some code in it, a box labeled "preview",
    and a box labled "Console". Delete the code in the code box and copy
    all the code in this file that is below the dashed line, then paste 
    the code you copied into the box on the website. From now on, you 
    
    Next, press the play
    button, you should see the words "Hello World!" pop up in the Console box.
*/

/*
This line of code tells the computer to write everything in the parentheses
to the console. Here, we're having the computer write "Hello World!"
*/
console.log("Hello World!");

/*  Mild: 
        1. Modify the line of code above so that the code outputs your name.
        2. Add a comment to the code above saying that you edited the code
    Medium: 
        1. Modify the code so that it prints two or more different lines.
